What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates the .git directory.  This allows you to begin tracking history.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Just stages changes ready to commit.  Allows you to commit only what you need.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Just add the files that make sense to the staging area with git add.
